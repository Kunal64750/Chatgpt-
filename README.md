# Chatgpt Project-
The homepage of ChatGPT is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. HTML gives the basic structure, like headings, buttons, and sections.

2. CSS makes it look nice with colors, fonts, and layouts.

3. JavaScript adds interactivity, like button clicks or smooth scrolling

So together, they create the clean and interactive homepage you see.
